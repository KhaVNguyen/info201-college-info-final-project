### Project Description
We will be using the Tuition Tracker Dataset, which is “powered by data provided by the U.S. Department of Education from IPEDS, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System”. From there we will be using the “financial aid,” “Graduation Rates,” and “Net Price” data sets. Each individual data set lists statistics for over 3400 individual colleges in the United States. We found the data set by searching for data sets related to student on reddit.com/r/datasets. With this data, we want to compile easy-to-digest information about college statistics in a given state (chosen by the user interactively).   

### Target Audience
Our target audience would be incoming college students and parents who want to gather data about college options and general information about said colleges in a quick and easily-understandable format. We want to provide them with as much information as possible without being too overwhelming so that they can make an informed decision about which college to attend. 

### Questions we are trying to answer
What are the statistics for lowest, mean, and highest net prices for colleges in the given state? 
What are the statistics for lowest,mean and highest federal  state  local or institutional grant aid for colleges in the given state? 
What are the statistics for the net graduation rate per year for each college in a given state?
